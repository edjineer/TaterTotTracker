## Lessons Learned During the Project

* CSS is still very fiddly, and I have a LOT to learn about front end development
* There's definitely still a need to verify data coming out of GenAI: ChatGPT told me that a 40 week baby should be around 700g, when other sources say closer to 3500grams. Thats significantly off
* BingAI Image Generator continues to impress, and you can get some solid consistent images of a similar style with similar prompts
* Scaling through json files is the way to go
* Github Kanban Project Planning tool is great. Here is a link to the [Kanban Board from development](https://github.com/users/edjineer/projects/1/views/1).
